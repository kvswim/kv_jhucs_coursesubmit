EN.580.689 Computational Personal Genomics (3.0)
[Cross-listed from BME - CS students can count as a CS course.] What can we learn from the genome sequence of an individual? Genomic technology now makes it possible to generate huge amounts of DNA sequence data for a single individual at a relatively low cost. To make sense of this data, we need to employ sophisticated computational methods to identify genetic variations that influence an individual's health. 
    In this course, we will first review the state of the art in sequencing technology, and discuss how this technology is being applied to study human biology and disease. We will then explore the computational methods used to turn raw sequence data into knowledge. Topics will include genetic variant detection; discovery of chromosomal rearrangements and fusions; methods to measure gene expression from RNA; and measurements of the microbiome living inside our bodies.  Recommended prerequisites: EN.600.439/639, CS EN.600.363/463, 580.488/688, or permission of the instructor (any one is sufficient).  [Applications]

EN.600.311 [E] Sparse Representation in Computer Vision (1.0)
Techniques from sparse signal representation have seen significant impact in computer vision, often on non-traditional applications where the goal is not just to obtain a compact high-fidelity representation of the observed signal, but also to extract semantic information. The choice of dictionary plays a key role in bridging this gap: unconventional dictionaries consisting of, or learned from, the training samples themselves provide the key to obtaining state-of-the-art results and to attaching semantic meaning to sparse signal representations. Understanding the good performance of such unconventional dictionaries in turn demands new algorithmic and analytical techniques. This short course highlights a few representative examples of how the interaction between sparse signal representation and computer vision can enrich both fields.

Often the success of a machine learning project depends on the choice of features used. Machine learning has made great progress in training classification, regression and recognition systems when “good” representations, or features, of input data are available.  However, much human effort is spent on designing good features which are usually knowledge-based and engineered by domain experts over years of trial and error. A natural question to ask then is “Can we automate the learning of useful features from raw data?”. Representation learning algorithms such as principal component analysis aim at discovering better representations of inputs by learning transformations of data that disentangle factors of variation in data while retaining most of the information. The success of such data-driven approaches to feature learning depends not only on how much data we can process but also on how well the features that we learn correlate with the underlying unknown labels (semantic content in the data). This course will focus on scalable machine learning approaches for learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled, multi-modal, and heterogeneous data.  We will cover topics including deep learning, multi-view learning, dimensionality reduction, similarity-based learning, and spectral learning.

EN.600.761 Computer Vision Techniques for Multi-Sensor Image Fusion (2.0)
With the continuing advancement of various sensor technologies, multiple imaging modalities are more often becoming simultaneously available for deriving information from the world. In medical imaging, MRI, CAT, and PET modalities can be separately used to image the same tissue, providing complementary information for visualization and diagnosis. Cameras using objective lenses are now available that image in the visible, Near-infrared, ShortWave-infrared and Thermal Infrared spectrums; in combinations of two or more modalities these can provide vastly enhanced information about the physical world. This seminar will study a variety of computer vision techniques for both visual image fusion, such as for enhancing human visual perception beyond the visible spectrum, as well as analytic image fusion such as for enhancing the performance of automated object and face recognition. Recommended: EN.600.641 or equivalent.

Examples of topics we will address include metric embeddings and their applications, algorithms to exploit low dimensionality, graph spanners and sparsifiers, and data structures such as distance oracles and compact routing schemes that allow us to efficiently find distances and paths.  This course will mostly be in the form of a reading group, and students will present a paper and lead a discussion.  Prereq: EN.600.363/463 or permission of the instructor.

EN.600.771 Probability on Strings, Trees, and Sequences (1.0)
Many areas of practical computer science focus on discrete data that is sequential or tree-shaped: natural language processing (sentences and their analyses), computational biology (DNA and protein structures),  programming languages (computer programs and their interpretations), and compression (sequences of bits). When the data is noisy or ambiguous, decision-making requires probabilistic methods. We will survey formal tools for manipulating sets of strings, trees, sequences, and defining probabilistic models over these sets. Much of the material covers advanced topics at the intersection of formal language and automata theory, probability, and algorithms. Respectively, these three areas will enable us to represent sets, represent uncertainty, and process everything efficiently.

EN.600.772 Selected Topics in Linear Programming and Semi-definite Programming (1.0)
Linear programming and semi-definite programming are powerful techniques in convex optimization. They have been used to achieve the best known approximation results for many important combinatorial optimization problems, such as vertex cover, max cut, sparsest cut and MAX-2-SAT. In this course we will together explore the applications of these techniques in computer science, as well as some recent results about their limitations. Time permitting, we may also discuss their connections to the well-known unique games conjecture.  This course will be in the form of a reading group, and students are encouraged to select a paper and lead a discussion. Prereq: EN.600.463, EN.600.464 or permission.
